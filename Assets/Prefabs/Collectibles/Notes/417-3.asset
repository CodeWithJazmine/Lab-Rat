  - "Summary: The group began to panic and started fighting, I had to find a way
    out of that room.  While everyone was asleep, I found a broken piece of a clip
    board and used it to unscrew the vent located above the door. Once I was on the
    other side, I saw Subject #417 shambling through the corridor. It was even more
    grotesque than I remembered, but that didn\u2019t matter. I found Dr. Lee\u2019s
    note about the ZA-1 antibody. After nearly spending a month in that room, it
    was time I finished her work and put an end to this nightmare. I quickly left
    to the nearest lab and began working on ZC-25."
