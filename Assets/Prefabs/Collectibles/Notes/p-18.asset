  title: Patient #18
  note: "Date: June XX, XXXX  I am an infected patient who came to this lab seeking
    treatment. I was bitten two days ago and started to feel sick and angry. Word
    about an experimental treatment spread to my city, and I came as quickly as I
    could. They gave me a dose of the compound ZC-23, and it started to help me feel
    better. I was filled with hope, this nightmare would be over soon. However, as
    I was sleeping the next night, I was violently awoken by a nightmare. My mind
    was filled with confusion, thoughts of insatiable hunger.  I need food! Meat!
    I must feast upon flesh! No, I can\u2019t! But I\u2019m so hungry\u2026  I\u2019m
    sorry patient #19, but I must put something in my stomach."
