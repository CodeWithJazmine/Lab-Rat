  - 'Subject: Zombie virus outbreak - Patient influx'
  - "Summary: Over the past month the lab has been receiving an increasing number
    of infected patients. The patients all share the symptoms of the zombie virus.
    Our team is working as fast as they can to treat everyone, but we\u2019re running
    out of supplies. Compound ZC-23 seems to be ineffective, only causing each patient\u2019s
    symptoms to be worse. There aren\u2019t enough rooms to hold everyone. We need
    to come up with a new solution, and fast. A distress signal was sent to the military
    for assistance, I hope it reaches them in time."
