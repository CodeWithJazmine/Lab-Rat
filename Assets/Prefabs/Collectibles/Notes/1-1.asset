  - 'Summary: Our first subject, John Murphy, a 23-year-old male, has been given
    a dose of the ZC-23 compound.'
  - "Results: The compound showed remarkable signs of effectiveness, such as curing
    the fever, pain, and aggression of the subject. Further tests showed successful
    prevention of further mutation, and the subject\u2019s body began to heal itself.
    After 24 hours, the subject regained normal cognitive and emotional functions,
    and they were able to communicate with staff. However, three days later, the
    subject fell into a deep coma. They are to be transferred to the ICU until further
    notice."
