  note: "Date: July XX, XXXX  I won\u2019t go into too much detail as to how I got
    sick, but I came to this lab looking to be cured. They gave me a shot of something
    that they thought would help. They better be right.  Date: August XX, XXXX  I
    overheard the doctors say they were working on a new cure. I asked about it,
    but they said it wasn\u2019t ready to be administered. I got angry, really angry.
    I wasn\u2019t myself. I threw myself at the doctor, as if that would have helped
    me. They locked me in my room by myself, said they would be back. I\u2019m starting
    to get hungry\u2026"
