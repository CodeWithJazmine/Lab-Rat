  title: Subject #1-2
  note: "Labe Note #XX  Date: August XX, XXXX  Subject: Subject #1 ICU treatment 
    Summary: We have been conducting further test on subject #1, who fell into a
    coma after receiving compound ZC-23. Their condition had unknown causes, but
    we had to continue our search. We performed a blood analysis and discovered something
    remarkable, subject #1 had a rare genetic mutation that produced a special antibody
    in his blood. The antibody, ZA-1, was able to neutralize the virus and prevent
    it from infecting of damaging cells. In order to use this ZA-1, we need to isolate
    it from subject #1\u2019s blood, but the only Doctor who can is currently quarantined. 
    Signed: Dr. Lee, Lead Scientist"
