  - 'Subject: Zombie virus outbreak and new chemical compound'
  - 'Summary: We have been working on a new chemical compound that could potentially
    cure the zombie virus that has been spreading across the world. The compound,
    named ZC-23, is a synthetic derivative of a natural plant extract. We tested
    the compound on several infected humans in our secure facility.'
  - 'Results: After the compound was administered to the patients, it began to show
    initial signs of effectiveness. Patients experienced a reduction in fever, pain,
    and aggression. However, after 24 hours of injection, the compound had a significantly
    negative effect on the subjects, causing them to become more violent, erratic,
    and cannibalistic. The compound triggered a mutation in the virus, making it
    more contagious and caused the subjects bodies to mutate rapidly. The facility
    was put on lockdown, but the experiments will continue.'
